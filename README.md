This is the project code for IMDB movie reviews sentiment analysis.

IMDB_sentiment_analysis_LSTM.py: the codes of data process and LSTM model setting.

IMDB_sentiment_analysis_LSTM.ipynb: you can see the running results directly in this file.

P.S. I download the dataset from the IMDB using Keras in python directly.
